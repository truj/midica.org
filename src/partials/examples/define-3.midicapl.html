// But during the DEFINE commands,...
;  ...this is different:

DEFINE CHORD   crd    // must use DEFINE and //
DEFINE DEFINE  def    // must use DEFINE and //
def    REST    %      // may use DEFINE or def...
DEFINE GLOBAL  glob   // ...but still must use //
def    COMMENT ;      // must still use //
def    CALL    invoke ;  now we may use ; or //
def    TEMPO   bpm    // both is ok

0: c:4  // may use ; or // for comments
0: %    ;  but must use % for rests

// must use the original symbol for file includes
INCLUDE  includefile1.midica

DEFINE INCLUDE incl

// now we may use both versions.
INCLUDE  includefile2.midica
incl     includefile3.midica
