			<h2>Channel Options</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<p>
				As mentioned before, a channel command can have options. Everything after the length column is regarded as options.
				An option has a name and (most of the time) also a value, separated by <code>=</code> and/or whitespaces. If a channel command has
				more than one option, the options are separated by <code>,</code>. Additional whitespaces are allowed, but not needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each option has a long name and an abbreviation, which can be used instead of the long name. But enough theory, here are the options:

			<h3>Velocity</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The velocity is the force with which a note is played. The more velocity, the louder the note. The option name is <code>velocity</code>.
				The short form is <code>v</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The value can be between 1 and 127. The default is 100. If the velocity option is used in a channel command, the following commands in the same
				channel will also use this velocity value. As long as the option is used in the same channel again, with a different value.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.velocity }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The example shows different ways to use the long or short form of the option.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Duration</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The duration option describes after which percentage of the note length, the pressed key is released.
				The option name is <code>duration</code>. The short form is <code>d</code>.
				The values can be either floating point numbers or percentage values ending with <code>%</code>.
				Low values result in "staccato", high values result in "legato".
			</p>
			<p>
				If two notes are played after each other, and the duration value is 1.0 (or 100%) then the first note is released in the same
				moment when the second one is pressed. A value of 0.9 (or 90%) means that the first note is released after 90% of its
				official duration. So the note is 10% shorter than its theoretical length.
			</p>
			<p>
				The default value is 0.95 (or 95%), meaning that the key is released 5% before its theoretical end.
				Values greater than 1.0 are also allowed. Then the notes overlap: The former note is released after the following one begins.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the duration option is used in a channel command, the following commands in the same channel will use the same duration value.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.duration-ratio }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				This example shows different ways how to use the long or short form of the duration option, with a floating point or percentage value.
				The last two lines show how different options can be combined. In this case duration and velocity.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Quantity</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				With the quantity option you can repeat the same channel command any number of times. The option name is <code>quantity</code>.
				The short form is <code>q</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows the beginning of "The Four Seasons: Summer", 3rd movement, by "Antonio Vivaldi".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.quantity }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				As you can see, this option can reduce the source code lines. In channel 1 it is used for 8th notes, together with a duration value
				of 50%.
				This is an alternative to combining 16th notes with 16th rests.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Multiple</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The multiple option is used to play different voices in the same channel.
				It allows to play different notes with different lengths and/or different velocity or duration options in
				the same time and channel.
				The option name is <code>multiple</code>. The short form is <code>m</code>. It does not have any value.
			</p>
			<p>
				As we already know, each channel command appends a note (or a chord or a rest) to the end of a channel. To be more precise,
				it adds the note to a <em>marker</em> that is usually at the end of the channel.
				After adding the note, this marker is moved from the old end of the channel to the new end of the channel.
			</p>
			<p>
				But if the channel command has the multiple option, the marker is not moved.
				So the next note that is added to the channel, begins at the same time like the note with the multiple option.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.multiple }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				This example shows some possibilities to use the multiple option. The first bar uses 2 voices, shown as blue and black.
				The full note and the first quarter note (g) begin in the same time because of the multiple option.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the second example we have 2 voices again (blue and black). But they don't begin in the same time, so we need to add
				a rest in the black voice. The blue voice sounds longer than the black one, so we need another rest at the end of the
				second bar.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the third bar we have three voices: blue, green and black. They all begin at different times but end in the same time.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Lyrics</h3>
			<div class="cell">
				<p>
					The lyrics option can be used to add a syllable to the command. This way you can make your song ready for karaoke.
					The option name is <code>lyrics</code>. The short form is <code>l</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you need whitespaces inside of the syllabe, you must use the following symbols:
				</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>_</code> for a space</li>
						<li><code>\r</code> for a new line</li>
						<li><code>\n</code> for a new paragraph</li>
						<li><code>\c</code> for a comma <code>,</code></li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					The following example shows how to create a karaoke version of "Happy Birthday".

		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.lyrics }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>The last screenshot shows how the result looks inside of the player in karaoke mode.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Tremolo</h3>
			<div class="cell">
				<p>
					The tremolo option is an alternative notation for note (or chord) repetitions.
					The option name is <code>tremolo</code>. The short form is <code>tr</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The note length column of a tremolo'ed note defines the overall length over all repetitions.
					The length of each repeated note is proveded as the option value.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next two examples are equivalent. The first one uses the tremolo option, while the second one uses the quantity option.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.tremolo }}</div>
			<div class="cell">
				<p>
					As you can see in the last line, the tremolo option can also be used to express drum rolls.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Shift</h3>
			<div class="cell">
				<p class="hint">
					This section describes a lowlevel form of transposing. Probably you will never need it.
					You can find a more usable form for transpositions in the chapters 3 and 4.
				</p>
				<p>
					The shift option transposes the given note or chord an arbitrary number of half tone steps into one direction.
					The option name is <code>shift</code>. The short form is <code>s</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The value is the number of half tone steps for the transposition. It can be negative for a lower transposition
					or positive for a higher transposition.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next two examples are equivalent. The first one uses the shift option, while the second one just uses normal notes.

	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="length-definitions">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Length Definitions</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				As you learned in chapter 1, the third column of a channel command defines the length of the note (or chord or rest).
				The easyest form of such a length definition is an atomic length like <code>/4</code>. This can be modified by special symbols like
				<code>.</code>. Most of the time you don't need anything more. But in some cases you may need more complicated definitions. In those
				cases you can combine more than one length definition and build a sum of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Atomic Lengths</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				The following atomic lengths are defined:
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>/1</code> (full),
				<code>/2</code> (half),
				<code>/4</code> (quarter),
				<code>/8</code> (eighth),
				<code>/16</code> (sixteenth),
				<code>/32</code> (thirty-second)
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>*1</code> (full),
				<code>*2</code> (double),
				<code>*4</code> (four wholes),
				<code>*8</code> (eight wholes),
				<code>*16</code> (sixteen wholes),
				<code>*32</code> (thirty-two wholes)
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also use just numbers without <code>/</code> or <code>*</code>. In this case, the number is interpreted as Xth note.
				This way you can also have more notes than the ones described above. E.g. <code>64</code> is interpreted as a sixty-fourth note (1/64).
				Or <code>5</code> will be a fifth note (1/5).
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason, this tutorial uses <code>/4</code> instead of <code>4</code> most of the time is that it's just more readable.
				But the result is the same.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.atomic }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				<h3>Modified Lengths</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>Dot Modifiers</h4>
			</p>
			<p>
				An atomic length can be modified. You already know the modifier <code>.</code>. It makes the atomic length one half longer, so that it's 3/2
				of the atomic length.
				You can add as many dots as you want. Two dots (<code>..</code>) make it longer by three quarters, resulting in 7/4 of it's atomic length.
				Three dots result in 15/8 of the atomic length. And so on.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.dot }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Channel 1 is only added for comparison reasons.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell" id="triplet">
			<p>
				<h4>Triplet Modifiers</h4>
			</p>
			<p class="hint">
				This section describes a lowlevel form of defining triplets. An easier to write (highlevel) form will follow in chapter 4.
			</p>
			<p>
				A triplet modifier shortens the atomic length by one third, resulting in 2/3 of the atomic length.
				The triplet modifier is a <code>t</code>.
				Just like a dot, a triplet can be applied as often as you want, resulting in nested triplets.
				Two triplet modifiers result in a length of 4/9 (2/3 * 2/3). Three such symbols result in 8/27 (2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3). And so on.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.triplet }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Channel 1 is added for comparison reasons again.
				The first triplet consists of 3 shortened eighths taking the time of a quarter.
				The second triplet is only slightly more complicated. It also contains a dotted eighth and a sixteenth.
			</p>
			<p>
				The third triplet contains a dotted note again. But this time the dot is placed before the <code>t</code> symbol.
				This demonstrates that the order
				of modifiers does not matter. The triplet also contains a rest that needs to have a modified length as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				The fourth triplet contains a nested triplet, marked in blue. So the notes of the inner triplet need to be modified by two
				<code>t</code> symbols.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last triplet consists of three half notes having the length of one full note. It also contains a chord.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell" id="tuplet">
			<p>
				<h4>Tuplet Modifiers</h4>
			</p>
			<p class="hint">
				This section describes a lowlevel form of defining tuplets. An easier to write (highlevel) form will follow in chapter 4.
			</p>
			<p>
				A triplet is only one special type of tuplet. Generally a tuplet is used to change the length of a sequence of notes in a way that
				has to be defined in the tuplet definition. A Tuplet modifier is defined by the symbol <code>t</code>, followed by two numbers that
				are separated by <code>:</code>. So a triplet could also be defined as <code>t3:2</code> meaning something like "3 for 2" or "3 notes
				have the length of 2".
			</p>
			<p>
				Mathematically you can say: tX:Y means that the length is multiplied with Y/X. So a note inside of a quadruplet would be modified with
				<code>t4:3</code>. And something inside a quintuplet with <code>t5:4</code>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.tuplet }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Again, channel 1 is only added for comparison reasons.
				The first tuplet is a 5:2 tuplet that could contain 5 notes (or rests) with the length of 2. So the length of each note or rest
				is modified by 2/5.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second tuplet is a 3:4 tuplet modifying all lengths by 4/3. So you see that a tuplet can also be defined to make notes longer
				instead of shorter. This tuplet contains a nested triplet (marked in blue) that has been explicitly defined as <code>t3:2</code>
				instead of <code>t</code>. Because of the nesting, both tuplet modifiers have to be attached to each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last tuplet contains different note lengths and a chord.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				<h3>Sums of Lengths</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes a note length cannot be described easily with an atomic or modified length. But it can easily be described as a sum of two lengths.
				In sheet music such notes are typically printed as 2 notes with a <em>tie</em> between them.
				In MidicaPL such a note length can be described as two atomic or modified lenghts, separated by a <code>+</code> symbol.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows the first few notes of "Hey Jude" by the "Beatles".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.hey-jude }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A half and an eighth note are tied together. This is described as <code>/2+/4</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				More complicated expressions are also possible like <code>/2.+/1+/2t</code>:
			</p>

	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="percussion">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Percussion Instruments</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				In order to produce sounds, we learned how to configure a certain instrument for a channel. Then we used notes to play
				different pitches in that channel. With Percussion instruments this is different.
				A percussion instrument has only one pitch. It's somthing like a drum, a hand clap, a cow bell or a triangle.
				Using notes for such instruments is not very useful.
			</p>
			<p>
				Percussion instruments are usually played in channel 9, the special percussion channel. In the <code>INSTRUMENTS</code> block
				this channel cannot be associated with an instrument but with a drumkit.
			</p>
			<p>
				When playing something later in this channel, this is not a note but a certain percussion instrument.
				Instead of the note name you write a percussion ID. Each percussion instrument has a long ID and a short ID.
				The valid IDs can be seen in the <em>info window</em> under <a href="/screenshots.html#info-config">Configuration / Percussion IDs</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next two examples are equivalent. They play the intro for "We Will Rock You" by "Queen".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.we-will-rock-you }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The only difference is that the first example uses long percussion IDs and the second one uses short IDs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like a chord of notes, you can also play two percussion sounds in the same time. Just separate the IDs with a <code>,</code>.
				The following example shows the bedinning of "Billie Jean" by "Michael Jackson".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.billie-jean }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The short percussion IDs from this example are equivalent to the following long IDs:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>hhc</code> equals <code>hi_hat_closed</code></li>
				<li><code>sd1</code> equals <code>snare_drum_1</code></li>
				<li><code>bd1</code> equals <code>bass_drum_1</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The first result score is easier to read for non-drummers. The second one is more compact and more what a drummer is used to read.

		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Using Soundfonts</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Include Soundfont File</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				In the preparation section you learned how to <a href="/tutorial.html#sound">load a Soundfont</a> manually in the main window of
				the Midica application.
			</p>
			<p>
				But there are a lot of different soundfonts out there, specialized for different kinds of music. So maybe you want to use different
				soundfonts for different songs. And maybe you don't want to choose the soundfont file manually each time you switch to another
				MidicaPL file containing another song.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this case you can use the <code>SOUNDFONT</code> command. Its only argument is the path to a soundfont file in the
				<code>.sf2</code> format. The path can be either absolute or relative to the source file containing the command.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.soundfont }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Of cause this does not work on someone else's computer because he will probably not have the same
				soundfont in the same file path inside of his fils system.
				And it will also not work in an exported MIDI file because soundfont information cannot be stored in a MIDI sequence.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Bank Descriptions</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				In chapter 1 you already learned the simplest form of defining <a href="/tutorial-1.html#instruments">instruments</a> for each channel.
				Remember: In the second column of each line we used an <em>instrument ID</em> or a <em>drumkit ID</em> or a
				<em>MIDI program number</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each ID is mapped to a program number internally. And program numbers can only have values from 0 to 127.
				But comprehensive soundfonts can contain much more than 128 different instruments. In this case the instruments
				are selected by a combination of a <em>program number</em> and a <em>bank description</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the second column of an instrument line the bank description can be attached to the ID or program number separated by a
				<code>,</code> symbol. So <code>VIOLIN,5</code> or <code>40,5</code> would select a violin with the bank description "5".
			</p>
			<p>
				A Bank description can consist of an <abbr title="Most Significant Byte">MSB</abbr> (0-127) and an
				<abbr title="Least Significant Byte">LSB</abbr> (0-127), separated by a <code>/</code> symbol.
				E.g. <code>VIOLIN,5/3</code> would use a violin (program number 40) with a bank MSB of 5 and an LSB of 3.
			</p>
			<p>
				For most soundfonts you only need the MSB, like in the first example. In this case the LSB is 0.
				So <code>VIOLIN,5</code> is the same as <code>VIOLIN,5/0</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				And if MSB and LSB are both zero, you can omit both and only use the ID or program number. That was the case in the examples from
				chapter 1. So the following instrument definitions are all equal:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>VIOLIN</code></li>
				<li><code>VIOLIN,0</code></li>
				<li><code>VIOLIN,0/0</code></li>
				<li><code>40</code></li>
				<li><code>40,0</code></li>
				<li><code>40,0/0</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Alternatively a bank description can also be a full bank number. This can be calculated the following way:
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre>bank number = MSB * 128 + LSB</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				That means that the following instrument definitions are equal:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>VIOLIN,5/3</code></li>
				<li><code>VIOLIN,643</code> (5 * 128 + 3 = 643)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Some soundfonts support multi-channel drumkits. That is a drumkit that can also be used in channels other than 9.
				Often such drumkits are located on bank 15360 (MSB 120, LSB 0).
				The following example assumes that you use such a soundfont.

		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Instrument Switch</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Sometimes you may need to switch the instrument of one or more channels.
				Then you have to reconfigure these channels accordingly. This can be done in a block or a single line.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Instruments Block</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				One way to switch instruments is to use the same kind of <code>INSTRUMENTS</code>
				block that you already know. However this block can only contain channels that you have already initialized inside
				of the very first <code>INSTRUMENTS</code> block of your source code.
			</p>
			<p>
				If your first <code>INSTRUMENTS</code> block was the one from the <em>Bank Descriptions</em> section above, you can later
				define a second <code>INSTRUMENTS</code> block that redefines all channels except 6, 7 and 8.
			</p>
			<p>
				Or you can redefine only channel 0, 5, 9 and 15. Then the channels 1-4 and 10-14 would continue using their already
				defined instruments. This would look like the following example:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.instruments-3 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Single Instrument Switch</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Alternatively you can reconfigure a channel in one single line. Therefore the <code>INSTRUMENT</code> command is used.
				(Pay attention to the singular form.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>INSTRUMENT</code> command is followed by the channel number, the instrument definition and the channel description.
			</p>
			<p>
				The rules for channel number, instrument definition and channel details are the same as the rules
				inside of an <code>INSTRUMENTS</code> block. The only difference is that the channel description is optional.
				If it's ommitted, Midica re-uses the old channel description.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example switches the instruments of the channels 0 and 1:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.instrument }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				With the first command, we simulate a switch of the viola from <em>arco</em> to <em>pizzicato</em> mode.
				Therefore we need a new MIDI instrument in channel 0 but not necessarily a new channel description.
				So we skip that.
			</p>
			<p>
				In channel 1 we switch to a completely different instrument, using a non-standard bank number.
				The program number is the one of a steel guitar but in the current soundfont it's mapped to a mandolin.
				So we use an appropriate channel description to avoid confusion.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another reason to use the single line instrument switch is that it also works inside of a function or block.
				In the next two chapters you will learn what that is.

				The rest of the variable name can consist of letters, numbers or underscores. Variable names are case-sensitive.
			</p>
			<p>
				A variable is defined and initialized with the keyword <code>VAR</code>, followed by the variable name, an optional
				<code>=</code> symbol (and/or whitespaces) and the value.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later it can be used by just writing the variable's name.
				The following examples are equivalent. The first one uses variables, the second one doesn't.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.variable }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				As you can see, you can assign a new value to an already defined variable. This works exactly like the initial definition.
			</p>
		</div>

			<h3>Limitations of Variables</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				There are some limitations for the usage of variables.
				<ul>
					<li>
						A variable cannot contain any whitespaces.
					</li>
					<li>
						Variables are officially supported to be used in the following locations:
						<ul>
							<li>As a channel number in a channel command, or a part of it</li>
							<li>As a note, rest, chord or percussion ID in a channel command, or a part of it</li>
							<li>As a duration description in a channel command, or a part of it</li>
							<li>As an option value (or a part of it) in any command that supports options</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				In all other locations you should not use variables. They may work or not. But even if they work, they may not
				work in a later Midica version any more.
