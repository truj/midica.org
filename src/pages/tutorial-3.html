			<p>
				This is the third chapter of the MidicaPL tutorial. Please read <a href="tutorial-1.html">chapter 1</a> and
				<a href="tutorial-2.html">chapter 2</a> first, if you have not yet done that already.
			</p>
			<p>
				So far you learned a lot about lowlevel commands. In this and the next chapter we will focus on highlevel structures
				that help to reuse your code. This chapter is about functions.
			</p>

			<h2>Functions</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Most programming languages have functions, methods, subroutines or something similar that can be called from different places
				inside of your source code. In MidicaPL such a structure is called <em>function</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				A function is a bock beginning with the keyword <code>FUNCTION</code>, followed by one or more whitespaces and a self-given function name.
				The block is closed with the keyword <code>END</code>.
				Inside the block you can write as many channel or global commands as you want.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example defines two functions for "Another one bites the dust" by "Queen".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one-drum-bass }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				First we introduce the bass instrument in channel 5 so that we can use it later. Then we define the functions.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first function is called <code>bassline</code>. It defines the main bassline and has a length of 8 quarter notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second function is called <code>drums</code>. It defines the drum beat with a length of 2 quarter notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				So far no sound is produced at all. The functions have been defined but they have not yet been used.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later we want to play the bass and the drums together. The <code>bassline</code> function is 4 times longer
				than the <code>drums</code> function.
				That means we need to call <code>drums</code> 4 times more often than <code>bassline</code>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A function can be called with the <code>CALL</code> command, followed by one or more whitespaces and the function name.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can imagine that a <code>CALL</code> command is internally replaced by the code inside of the function.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example plays the functions that we have defined before. The first source code version uses <code>CALL</code> commands.
				The second version shows how these CALLs would look like if they were replaced by the according function contents.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Both functions play in different channels. So if we call them after each other they play simultaneously.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A function can also be called from another function.
				So an alternative for the last example would be the usage of a further function:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				Now we need to handle the different lengths of the bass and drum functions only at one place: inside the function <code>drum-and-bass</code>.
				Later we can call this function as often as we want.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				In the last example we defined the function first and called it later. But the other way round is also possible.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one-3 }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				In this example the function is called before it is defined.
			</p>
		</div>

			<h2>Call Options</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<p>
				Do you remember the <a href="tutorial-2.html#channel-options">channel command options</a> from chapter 2?
			</p>
			<p>
				A <code>CALL</code> command can also have options.
				As you can see in the <em>Call Options</em> table, the following options are also allowed as call options:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>quantity</code> (short version: <code>q</code>)</li>
				<li><code>multiple</code> (short version: <code>m</code>)</li>
				<li><code>shift</code> (short version: <code>s</code>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Besides these, we also have a new option:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>if</code> (no short version available)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<table>

		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Call options are attached to the end of the <code>CALL</code> command line, separated from the rest of the command
				by one or more whitespaces.
			</p>
			<p>
				If an option requires a value, this must be appended to the option name, separated by a <code>=</code> symbol or whitespace(s).
			</p>
				If different options are used, they have to be separated by a <code>,</code> symbol.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Quantity</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Probably you already have guessed what the <code>quantity</code> option does: It repeats the function call as often as defined by
				the option value.
				So we can rewrite our calls using the quantity option. The following versions are all equivalent:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one-q }}</div>
		<div class="cell" id="call-m">
			<h3>Multiple</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>multiple</code> option can be used to implement different voices playing in the same channel in the same time.
				It plays the function and then moves the end markers of each involved channel to the position they had before calling the function.
			</p>
			<p>
				In other words: After playing a function with this option, the next notes in the same channels are played in the same time as the function.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next example shows how we can use this option in order to play a small variation.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one-complete }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The red part is the anacrusis (upbeat) without drums. The sync command (<code>* time 4/4</code>) synchronizes
				the involved channels so that the drums start after the anacrusis. And it also switches to 4/4 beat.
			</p>
			<p>
				The blue part adds two bass notes to the end of the second measure. Therefore the first <code>CALL</code> command
				is marked as <code>multiple</code> so that the following code is added to the time where the call started.
			</p>
			<p>
				As we want to add something to the last eighth of the measure, we need to fill up the beginning with rests in the bass channel.
				We need a whole rest with three dots.
			</p>
			<p>
				After adding the rest and the notes, our bass channel is two measures further than our percussion channel. So we need to synchronize them
				again with another <code>*</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then we are ready to call <code>drum-and-bass</code> again a few times.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Shift</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>shift</code> option can be used to transpose a whole function up or down by an arbitrary number of half tone steps.
				Use a positive number to shift the function up or a negative value to shift it down.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows how this works. It shows the first two measures of the harpsichord part of Antonio Vivaldi's
				"Four Seasons - Summer" (3rd movement).
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.vivaldi-shift-harpsic }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The right and left hand play both the same notes, but in a different octave.
			</p>
			<p>
				First we introduce the Harpsichord in channel 6. Then we define a function for the first two measures.
				We call this function for the right hand of the harpsichord first. Therefore we use the <code>m</code> option because we want to
				play the left hand in the same time.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second call of <code>measure_1-2</code> is for the left hand. We use the option <code>s=-12</code> to play the same
				notes one octave lower.
			</p>
			<p id="option-shift-second">
				Alternatively we can also use variables for the channel. Then we are able to use the same function for different channels.
				The next example demonstrates how this works:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.vivaldi-shift-variable }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				First we introduce our instruments in the channels 0, 4 and 6.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then we define the function for the first two measures again. But this time we use the variable <code>$ch</code> instead
				of a channel number.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later we set <code>$ch</code> to 0 and call the function for the lead violin. This is the red part in the example.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then we set <code>$ch</code> to 4 and call the function again. This time for the Violoncello. This is the blue part in the example.
				We use <code>shift=-12</code> because the Violoncello plays the same notes one octave lower. Like the left hand of the Harpsichord.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last (black) part switches to channel 6 and calls the function once for each hand of the Harpsichord.
				Just like in the example before.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell" id="call-if">
			<h3>If</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>if</code> option can be used to call a function only under a certain condition.
				The <em>condition</em> can be a variable having a certain value.
				The following example demonstrates how this works:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.volta }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The function <code>section</code> is called twice. When it's called the first time, the variable <code>$part</code> has a value of
				<code>1</code>, while the second time it's value is <code>2</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of <code>section</code> there are two conditional function calls, representing the two volta brackets
				(marked with <code>1.</code> and <code>2.</code> in the score).
			</p>
			<p>
				The line <code>CALL first-ending  if=$part==1</code> is executed only in the first call, when <code>$part</code> is <code>1</code>.
				The according condition is <code>$part==1</code>. It contains the operator <code>==</code> to check if the left and right side of the
				operator is equal. Only in this case, the function call is executed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The line <code>CALL second-ending if $part == 2</code> is working likewise. It is only executed in the second call.
				This time we only omitted the <code>=</code> between <code>if</code> and the condition part. So it looks more like in other
				programming languages. And we have added whitespaces around <code>==</code>, which is allowed in conditions. This makes the
				condition more readable.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are some more operators that can be used inside a condition, apart from <code>==</code>. You will learn more about
				them in the <a href="tutorial-4.html#conditions">next chapter</a>.
			</p>

		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Call Parameters</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				One important feature of functions in all major programming languages is the support of parameters.
				In MidicaPL this works as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore you need to add the symbols <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> directly after the function name (and before any options).
				Then you add your parameters between the parantheses, separated by <code>,</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				E.g. you can call the functon <code>foo</code> with the parameters <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
				three times and transposed one octave higher with the following command:
				<br />
				<code>CALL foo(a, b) q=3, s=12</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				A function call without parameters can also be made with an empty list. So the following calls are equivalent:
				<ul>
					<li><code>CALL foo</code></li>
					<li><code>CALL foo()</code></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				There are two types of parameters: <em>indexed</em> parameters and <em>named</em> parameters.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Indexed Parameters</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				An indexed parameter is a parameter without a name. So the order of the parameters in the <code>CALL</code> command
				is relevant.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's get back to our "Vivaldi" example and rewrite our function <code>measure_1-2</code> using indexed parameters
				<a href="#option-shift-second">instead of variables</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.vivaldi-param-indexed }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				Instead of changing a channel variable between the function calls, we pass the channel as the first parameter.
				And as the second parameter we pass the transposition value.
			</p>
			<p>
				Inside the function, we use these parameters with a <code>$</code> symbol, followed by an index, surrounded by
				square braces <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				A variable index starts counting from 0. That means, to use the first parameter, we must write <code>$[0]</code>
				and for the second one <code>$[1]</code>. A third one would be <code>$[2]</code>, and so on.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Named Parameters</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A named parameter is a parameter with a name. The following example is equivalent but uses named parameters instead
				of indexed parameters.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.vivaldi-param-named }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				A named parameter inside of a <code>CALL</code> command consists of a name and a value, separated by <code>=</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The order of the parameters doesn't matter.
			</p>
			<p>
				Inside the function, a named parameter is accessed by a <code>$</code> symbol, followed by the name, surrounded by
				<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In our example the channel is passed as <code>ch=...</code> and accessed as <code>${ch}</code>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Mixed Parameters</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Indexed and named parameters can be mixed. The following examples are equivalent but use a mix of indexed and named
				parameters inside of the same function calls.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.vivaldi-param-mixed }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The first example uses an indexd parameter for the channel and a named parameter for the transposition.
				The second example uses the opposite approach.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Scope of Parameters</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A variable in MidicaPL can be accessed globally, as soon as it is defined.
				But a call parameter is only valid inside the called function.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if you call a second function from inside the first function, you cannot access the first function's parameters
				from the second function. Not directly. But of cause you could pass the parameters over to the second function, like the following
				example shows:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.vivaldi-call-chain }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				The function <code>measure_1-2</code> uses mixed parameter types. The first parameter is named, while the second one
				is indexed. The named parameter is later used as <code>${ch}</code>, the second one is used as <code>$[1]</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>measure_1-2</code> does not directly implement the channel commands any more. Instead, it calls two other functions,
				one for each measure: <code>measure_1</code> and <code>measure_2</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Inside of <code>measure_1-2</code>, the parameters must be passed over to the <code>CALL</code> commands for
				<code>measure_1</code> and <code>measure_2</code>, so that they can be used there as well.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Lyrics as parameters</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Function parameters are especially useful for the lyrics of verses. In modern songs the melodies of different verses are
				typically the same. But the lyrics are not. So we can implement the vocal melody in a function and provide the lyrics as parameters.
				The following example shows how this can be done in "London Bridge":
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell large-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.london-bridge }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>vocals</code> function is called once for each verse, with the syllables as indexed parameters.
			</p>
			<p>
				Parts of the lyrics are repeated but with different notes. So the lyrics are delegated to further functions
				for the individual measures.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last two measures have always the same lyrics ("My fair Lady."). So the according function <code>refrain</code>
				doesn not need any parameters.
			</p>
