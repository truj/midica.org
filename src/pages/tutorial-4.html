				This is the fourth chapter of the MidicaPL tutorial. Please read the chapters <a href="tutorial-1.html">1</a>,
				<a href="tutorial-2.html">2</a> and <a href="tutorial-3.html">3</a> first, if you have not yet done that.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this chapter we will focus on nestable blocks that can be used for different things like loops or conditional executions.

			<h2>Nestable Blocks</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Functions are useful to group a number of commands and apply them later using a self-invented name.
				But sometimes you may want to group commands without inventing a name and execute them directly instead of calling them later.
				That's where nestable blocks are used.
			</p>
			<p>
				Programming languages also have nestable blocks. Typically they are used for <em>if</em> or <em>else</em> blocks or loops.
				In MidicaPL a nestable block is opened by a line beginning with <code>{</code> and closed by a line beginning with <code>}</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We switch back again to "Another one bites the dust" by "Queen" (see <a href="tutorial-3.html">chapter 3</a>).
				We rewrite the drums and bass of that song using nestable blocks:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.another-block }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				We formed a block for the bass part and a second one for the drums part. Both blocks are nested inside of another block.
				The commands are played directly without the need of a function call.
			</p>
			<p>
				But hey... The Bass part is played only once!
				One quick and dirty way to fix this problem is to use the <code>drums</code> function from chapter 3:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.another-block-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				So you see, a function can be called from inside a block as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand you can also use blocks inside of a <code>FUNCTION</code>.
				Let's rewrite the function <code>drum-and-bass</code> using blocks:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.another-block-3 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				These examples are equivalent. The first one uses blocks, the second one doesn't.
			</p>
			<p>
				The version with blocks doesn't need a function for the bass part. However the drums part is needed in both versions.
				And of cause we could have written the same thing completely without blocks. This was just a demonstration that
				blocks can be nested inside of functions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Blocks become much more useful when using block options.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="block-options">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Block Options</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<p>
				Just like <code>CALL</code> commands, nestable blocks can have options as well. The <span class="reference">block options</span> table shows the available options.
				As you can see, the following options are also available as block options:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>quantity</code> (short version: <code>q</code>)</li>
				<li><code>multiple</code> (short version: <code>m</code>)</li>
				<li><code>shift</code> (short version: <code>s</code>)</li>
				<li><code>if</code> (no short version available)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Moreover there are also some new options, only available for blocks:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>tuplet</code> (short version: <code>t</code>)</li>
				<li><code>elsif</code> (no short version available)</li>
				<li><code>else</code> (no short version available)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Options can be attached to the opening <code>{</code> or closing <code>}</code> brace, separated by whitespaces.
			</p>

		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				If you want (or must) pass a value to an option, the value must be appended to the option name, separated by a <code>=</code> symbol or whitespace(s).
			</p>
			<p>
				If more than one option is used, they have to be separated by a <code>,</code> symbol.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Quantity</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>quantity</code> option plays the according block as many times as its value defines.
				Eventually we are able to rewrite the function <code>drum-and-bass</code> correctly and without needing to define the functions <code>drums</code>
				and <code>bassline</code>:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.another-block-4 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				These two examples are equivalent. The first example uses the long form <code>quantity</code> and adds it to the <em>opening</em> brace.
				The second example uses the short form <code>q</code> for the <em>closing</em> brace.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another difference is that the second example omits the block around the bass part. This block is optional because without block options it
				does not do anything special.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Multiple</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>multiple</code> option (short form <code>m</code>) can be used to implement different voices playing in the same channel
				in the same time.
				It plays the block content and then moves the end markers of each involved channel to the position they had before the block has been opened.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example is equivalent to the example we used to explain the <code>multiple</code> option in a function call
				(<a href="tutorial-3.html#call-m">in chapter 3</a>).
				But this time we do it completely without functions, only with blocks.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.another-block-m }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The red part is the anacrusis (upbeat) again. The blue part defines the two notes at the end of the second measure. This is the part with the
				multiple option.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because  of this option, the following black part starts at the same time like the blue block.
				This black part is repeated three times.
			</p>
			<p>
				The multiple option is especially useful for music with complex percussion patterns, like in african or latin music.
				The following example shows a typical Mambo section with different percussion instruments playing different patterns in the same time.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.mambo }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The tom-tom part uses 2 different tom-tom drums.
				This pattern is the same in both measures, so the block is repeated by the option <code>q=2</code> at the end of the block.
				Besides, the option <code>m</code> (multiple) is used to reset the time, so that the next block begins in the same time.
				So you see how both options can be combined.
			</p>
			<p>
				The bass drum part, marked in blue, only uses the <code>multiple</code> option, here in it's long form. That's needed again because
				other parts are following that begin in the same time and in the same channel.
			</p>
			<p>
				The bell part defines a mambo bell pattern that is very common in afro-cuban music. Here we use the ride bell but it can also be used with
				a cow bell or other percussion instruments. This block ends with a multiple option (<code>m</code>) as well because there is still another
				drum part to follow with the same start time.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last block defines the clave rhythm that's also very typical for latin music like Mambo or Salsa.
				This block does not contain a <code>multiple</code> option because there is nothing more to follow.
			</p>
			<p>
				All these blocks are nested inside another block with the option <code>q=2</code>, so that everything is repeated.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Shift</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>shift</code> option (short form <code>s</code>) works exactly like the shift option for function calls.
				It transposes the whole block up or down by an arbitrary number of half tone steps.
				Nested blocks can have different <code>shift</code> options. In this case, the option values for all surrounding blocks are added up
				to calculate the resulting shift value.
			</p>
			<p>
				the following example demonstrates this:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.shift-block }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The first three notes are played 2 octaves lower because the outer block has a <code>shift</code> option of <code>-24</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next three notes are played only one octave lower because the <code>-24</code> of the outer block and the <code>+12</code> of
				the inner block are added, and the result is <code>-12</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last note has its own shift value of <code>+12</code> which is added as well. The result for this note is <code>0</code>, so
				the note is not shifted any more.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Tuplet</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>tuplet</code> option (short form <code>t</code>) is used to define that the block content is played as a tuplet.
				The option can be used without any value. In this case the tuplet is interpreted as a <em>triplet</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				the following example shows the same triplets that we saw already <a href="tutorial-2.html#triplet">in chapter 2</a>, but this time defined as blocks.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.triplet-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The blue part is again a nested triplet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alternatively a value can be passed to the <code>tuplet</code> option. The value consists of two numbers, separated by a <code>:</code>.
				A triplet could also be defined as <code>tuplet=3:2</code> (or <code>t=3:2</code>).
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>3:2</code> means that the length of each note inside the block is multiplied with 2/3.
			</p>
			<p>
				Or, more generally, X:Y means that each note length inside the block is multiplied with Y/X.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next example shows the same tuplet example we have seen <a href="tutorial-2.html#tuplet">in chapter 2</a>, but this time using block options.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.tuplet-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell" id="block-if">
			<h3>If</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>if</code> option can be used to execute a block only under a certain condition.
				This transforms the block into something like an <em>if</em> block in other programming languages.
				The following example is equivalent to the example we used for <code>if</code> <a href="tutorial-3.html#call-if">as a call option</a>.
				But this time we don't need any further function for the volta brackets (like
				<code>first-ending</code> or <code>second-ending</code>):
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.volta-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Another difference is that now we use parameters instead of global variables. We could not do that while
				explaining <code>if</code> as a CALL option because we didn't learn how to use parameters at that time.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Elsif</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>elsif</code> option can be used for a block <em>after</em> another block with the <code>if</code> option.
				It has its own condition.
				The <code>elsif</code> block is only executed, if:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The preceeding block is <em>not</em> executed (because it's <code>if</code> condition if false); <em>and</em></li>
				<li>The condition of the <code>elsif</code> option is true.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Here's a rewrite of the previous example with an <code>elsif</code>:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.volta-elsif }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				The <code>if</code> option in the second block is now replaced by an <code>elsif</code>.
				The condition of the <code>elsif</code> is now <code>${part} > 0</code>. That means, the condition is true, if
				the parameter <code>part</code> is a number higher than 0.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first call, the <code>if</code> block is executed. The <code>elsif</code> condition is also true, but as
				the first block is executed, the second one is skipped anyway.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the second call, the <code>if</code> block is skipped. So the <code>elsif</code> condition is evaluated, and because it's true,
				the second block is executed.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				You can also add more elsif blocks. Each block is only executed if:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>None of the preceeding <code>if</code> or <code>elsif</code> blocks is executed (because their conditions are all false); <em>and</em></li>
				<li>The condition of the block's <code>elsif</code> option is true.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Here's an example of such an if-elsif chain:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.volta-elsif-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Else</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				After a nestable block with an <code>if</code> or <code>elsif</code> option, you can add another
				block with the option <code>else</code>.
				This option does not have its own condition.
				The <code>else</code> block is only executed if none of the preceeding <code>if</code> or <code>elsif</code> blocks
				is executed.
			</p>
			<p>
				This enables us to rewrite the <code>if</code> <a href="#block-if">example</a> with only one condition check:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.volta-else }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				The <code>if</code> block is executed in the first call, while in the second call the <code>else</code> block is executed.
			</p>

			<h2>Conditions</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<p>
				The <code>if</code> or <code>elsif</code> options require a condition, as you learned before.
				There are several types of conditions, like the <span class="reference">Conditions</span> table shows.
			</p>
			<p>
				All conditions use an operator, apart from the <em>defined</em> condition.
			</p>

				Most of the operators expect two values, one of the left side and one of the right side of the operator.

			<h3>equal condition (==)</h3>

			<h3>lower condition (&lt;)</h3>

		<div class="cell">

				The <em>lower</em> condition uses the operator <code>&lt;</code>. It expects both values to be numbers.

		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>greater condition (&gt;)</h3>

		<div class="cell">

		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <em>lower or equal</em> condition uses the operator <code>&lt;=</code>. It expects both values to be numbers.

		<div class="cell">
			<h3>greater or equal condition (&gt;=)</h3>

			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>defined condition</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <em>defined</em> condition does not use any operator. It expects a call parameter as the only value.
				If the parameter has been provided with the <code>CALL</code> command, the condition is true. Otherwise it's false.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's an example:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.volta-defined }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				The parameter <code>foo</code> is only provided in the first call.
				Then the <code>if</code> block is executed. In the second call <code>${foo}</code> is undefined, and so
				the <code>else</code> block is executed.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>not defined condition (!)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <em>not defined</em> condition uses the operator <code>!</code>. It expects a call parameter as the only value,
				on the right side of the operator.
				If the parameter has been provided with the <code>CALL</code> command, the condition is false. Otherwise it's true.
			</p>
			<p>
				Summing up, it's the opposite of the <em>defined</em> condition.
			</p>
			<p>
				Example: <code>if ! ${foo}</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				This would be executed if the containing function has been called <em>without</em> a parameter <code>foo=...</code>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>in condition (in)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <em>in</em> condition uses the operator <code>in</code>. It expects a simple value or variable or parameter on the left side.
				On the right side it expects a list of values, variables or parameters, separated by <code>;</code>. Additional whitespaces are allowed
				but not required.
			</p>
			<p>
				The operator compares the left value with all values of the right side. If the left value is equal to one of the list's elements,
				the condition is true. Otherwise it's false.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's an example:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.volta-in }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>if</code> block is executed in the first call, because then <code>${foo}</code> is 0, which is in the list <code>0;1;5;10</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>elsif</code> block is executed in the second call, when <code>${foo}</code> is 2, which is <em>not</em> in the first list.
				But 2 is an element of the list <code>2 ; 3</code>, so the <code>elsif</code> condition is true.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the third call, <code>${foo}</code> is 4, which is in neither of the lists. So the <code>else</code> block is executed.
