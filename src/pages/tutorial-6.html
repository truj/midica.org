			<h2>Patterns</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<p>
				A pattern is a way how to play a given chord, or to be more general, a certain set of notes.
				The chord may change but the pattern stays the same.
			</p>
			<p>
				An example can be a certain guitar picking pattern. The right hand picks the same pattern
				while the left hand frets different chords.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to use a pattern, it must be defined somewhere. It can be defined before or after using it, just like a function.
			</p>
			<p>
				A pattern definition is a block beginning with the keyword <code>PATTERN</code>, followed by whitespace(s) and a pattern name.
				The block ends with the keyword <code>END</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later the pattern is used inside of a normal compact or lowlevel command, by using the pattern's name instead of a note length.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following two examples are equivalent.
				They define an empty pattern called <code>do_nothing</code>.
				This pattern is used later with different chords.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first example uses the pattern inside of compact commands, the second one inside of lowlevel commands.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-do-nothing }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				However this whole code does not produce any sound because the pattern is empty and does nothing with the chords.
				We will change that in the next section.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="pattern-block">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Pattern Block</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A pattern block contains information what to do with the chord. It can consist of:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>lines producing a compact command (using any combination of the provided notes or rests)</li>
				<li>lines producing a lowlevel command (with a rest, note or sub chord of the provided chord)</li>
				<li>nestable blocks</li>
				<li>nested patterns</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Compact commands in a Pattern</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Pattern lines that produce a compact command begin with a single <code>:</code> without a channel number.
				The rest of the line describes notes, chords or rests. But instead of using note names, each single note is addressed by a
				<em>note index</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The notes in the chord are sorted by pitch, from low to high. The lowest note has <em>note index</em> 0.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's investigate the following chord:
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>CHORD amin a-2 e- a- c e</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				In this case, <code>a-2</code> has note index 0, <code>e-</code> has index 1, <code>a-</code> has index 2, <code>c</code> has index 3
				and <code>e</code> has index 4.
			</p>
			<p>
				With this knowledge we change the above 'do nothing' example to something else: The first bar of "House of the Rising Sun".
				The following two examples are equivalent. The first one uses the pattern, the second one doesn't.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-do-something-compact }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				We renamed the pattern from <code>do_nothing</code> to <code>basic</code> because now it's actually doing something.
				Then we defined what to do with the A minor chord. As we only care about the first bar here, we didn't need more chords so far.
			</p>
			<p>
				The colors make clear where which part comes from.
				The channel (marked in blue) is only defined in the channel command <code>0: amin:basic</code>.
				The pattern itself doesn't contain a channel. (It could be used from several channels.)
				The note indices are marked in red. In the second example you see how the indices are translated into notes.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Lowlevel commands in a Pattern</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A pattern line producing a lowlevel command consists of the following elements, separated by white space(s):
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>note index</li>
				<li>note length</li>
				<li>options (optional)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The following example shows the same pattern as before, but with lowlevel pattern lines.
				Again the first example shows how to use the pattern, while the second one shows the equivalent lowlevel commands without pattern.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-do-something-lowlevel }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Again, the colors make clear where which part comes from.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now we want to add the next three bars. So we just add the missing chords again and apply the pattern on them.
				But we leave the pattern definition unchanged.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-house }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				We applied the pattern to amin and cmaj from a lowlevel command. But for the next two chords we used a compact command.
				So you see, this is completely exchangeable.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our song sounds already pretty well like the original. But if you are really picky and listen carefully, you may notice that
				only the first two bars are correct.
				The 3rd and 4th bar need a slightly different pattern. We will implement it with the name <code>alternate</code> - but this time we
				only use compact commands inside the patterns:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-house-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Chords in a Pattern</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A pattern can also contain a chord, consisting of more than one note in a line. Instead of comma-separating note names,
				like in normal channel commands, the note indices must be comma-separated to achieve that.
				The following examples show how that works. The first example uses a chord inside of a pattern, while the second one shows
				how this very same thing would look with normal channel commands:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-travis-lowlevel }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The following example is the same thing with compact commands - first with the pattern and then the equivalent code without pattern:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-travis-compact }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				This pattern is called <code>travis</code> because it implements the famous <em>Travis Pattern</em>, a finger picking pattern
				named after Merle Travis.
			</p>
			<p>
				The note indices <code>0,3</code>, marked in blue, are translated to the chord <code>c-,c</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to create the first 8 bars of "Dust in the wind", we only need to add a few more chords and use this pattern with them:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-dust }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Rests in a Pattern</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				In order to create a rest inside a pattern, just replace the note index with a dash: <code>-</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next example shows a small variation of the travis pattern, containing a rest. The first example shows
				the pattern with lowlevel commands, the second one with compact commands:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-rest }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Blocks in a Pattern</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A pattern can contain nestable blocks. The next two examples are equivalent.
				The first one uses nestable blocks in a pattern, while the second one shows how this would look without a pattern:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-block }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The inner block has a <code>multiple</code> option (<code>m</code>), so the note indices <code>0</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>
				(notes <code>c-</code>, <code>e-</code> and <code>g-</code>) are played together with note index <code>3</code>
				(note <code>c</code>).
			</p>
			<p>
				The outer block has the quantity option <code>q=2</code>, so it's repeated twice.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="options">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Options</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<p>
				As already mentioned, a pattern line producing a channel command can have options.
				Such a line will be transformed into a (lowlevel or compact) channel command, so only such options are allowed here
				that are allowed for the command type to be produced.
			</p>
			<p>
				But the line using the pattern is also a channel command. So it can also contain options (at least if it's called in lowlevel syntax).
				This makes things a bit complicated, and not all combinations are allowed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The options in a line using a pattern are called <em>outer options</em>, while the options inside a pattern are called <em>inner options</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="reference">Pattern Options</span> table shows which options are allowed as <em>inner</em> or <em>outer</em> option.

			<p>
				The following example shows how a chord can be played like an arpeggio,
				from the lowest to the highest pitch, with a length of a full note and a distance of a thirty-second:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-arpeggio }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<p>
				Inside of the pattern, each note index line has a <code>multiple</code> option (as an <em>inner option</em>, marked in blue)
				because the notes shall be played "more or less" simultaneously.
			</p>
			<p>
				But not completely simultaneously, so we need very small rests between the notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The whole thing shall still cover exactly a full note's length. So we wrap everything inside a <code>multiple</code> block
				and add a full note rest at the end.
			</p>
			<p>
				The line using this pattern has the <code>quantity</code> option as an <em>outer option</em>, marked in red, to play the pattern twice.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Inner Velocity &amp; Duration</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				There is a perculiarity for <code>velocity</code> and <code>duration</code>, if used as an <em>inner option</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pattern begins with the velocity and duration values from before the pattern usage (or the one supplied as outer option, if given).
				When it's changed inside the pattern (as an inner option), the new value is valid until the end of the pattern. After the pattern, the value
				from before the pattern usage is restored again. (Or the one from the outer option, if given.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example demonstrates how this works. Lowlevel first, then the same with compact syntax:
			</p>
			<div class="cell medium-6">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-velo-dur }}</div>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Everything begins with a velocity of 50 (piano) and a duration of 90%.
			</p>
			<p>
				The velocity is switched to 95 (forte) in the outer option of the pattern usage (lowlevel example).
				Or directly <em>before</em> the pattern usage (compact example).
			</p>
			<p>
				That means, the pattern begins with velocity = 95 and duration = 90%.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pattern switches the duration to 40% (staccato) with an inner option.
				(3rd pattern line of the lowlevel example, <code>(d=40%)</code> in the compact example)
			</p>
			<p>
				After the pattern ends, the duration is restored to 90%. But the velocity is not restored because it has been set with
				an outer option (lowlevel) or completely outside the pattern (compact).
				So it continues to be 95 (forte).
			</p>
		</div>

	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="inline-chords">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Inline Chords</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				When we introduced <em>note indices</em>, we learned that the chord's notes are sorted by pitch before being addressed via note index.
				But this is only true for predefined chords. When we use inline chords, the notes stay in the same order as they are written.
				The following example demonstrates the difference between predefined and inline chords. Lowlevel first, then the same with compact syntax:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-inline }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				We apply the same pattern first to three predefined chords and than to three inline chords.
				All six chords contain the same notes. Only the order is different.
			</p>
			<p>
				However the predefined chords produce the same sequence because they are sorted by pitch implicitely.
				But the inline chords produce different sequences.
			</p>
			<p>
				With this knowledge we can use our <code>upstroke</code> pattern from above to create an upstroke as well as a downstroke:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-downstroke }}</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="nested-patterns">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Nested Patterns</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			Patterns can be nested. That means that inside of a pattern you can use another pattern.
			The following example uses this technique to create a <code>downstroke</code> pattern using the <code>upstroke</code> pattern,
			that also works with predefined chords:
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-downstroke-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>downstroke</code> pattern just reverses the given chord and applies the <code>upstroke</code> pattern to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				But more complicated nestings are also possible. The following example assumes that the previously defined patterns <code>travis</code>,
				<code>upstroke</code> and <code>downstroke</code> are available. Lowlevel first, then the same with compact syntax:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-nested }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The pattern <code>main</code> uses the nested patterns <code>travis</code>, <code>upstroke</code> and <code>downstroke</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The nested pattern <code>downstroke</code> uses <code>upstroke</code> as a nested pattern. So we have two levels of nesting here.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="pattern-parameters">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Pattern Parameters</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Patterns can have parameters, just like functions. Pattern parameters are added in round braces after the pattern name,
				when using the pattern. They work exactly like function parameters. That means, there are <em>indexed</em> and <em>named</em> parameters.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following two examples are equivalent. They both rewrite the <code>upstroke</code> pattern so that the note length and note distance
				are provided as parameters. The first example uses indexed parameters, while the second one uses named parameters:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-params }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The pattern contains only lowlevel commands but for using it we use both types.
				For the first pattern call we use lowlevel syntax. In this case, there are no whitespaces allowed in the whole command
				- <code>cmaj:upstroke(/1,/8)</code> or <code>cmaj:upstroke(len=/1,dist=/8)</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the pattern is used in lowlevel syntax then whitespaces are optional, as the last line of the first example shows.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Now we can implement a parametrized <code>downstroke</code> pattern that uses <code>upstroke</code> as a nested pattern.
				So we need to pass the parameters over to the nested pattern:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-params-downstroke }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				This time we use lowlevel syntax for the nested pattern call. And mixed syntax for the outer pattern calls again.
			</p>
			<p>
				Remeber our "House of the Rising Sun" example above.
				The two patterns <code>basic</code> and <code>alternate</code> are pretty similar.
				They only differ in the last three notes. So we can use only one, parametrized pattern.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following two examples are equivalent. The first one uses this new approach, while the second one is the one from above, just for comparison:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-house-3 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				As you can see, the parantheses in the pattern usage are optional, if no parameters are used.
			</p>
			<p>
				So <code>0 amin basic</code> and <code>0 amin basic()</code> are equivalent. Or in compact syntax,
				<code>0: amin:basic</code> would be the same as <code>0: amin:basic()</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is just the same behaviour as in a function call.
			</p>
		</div>

	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="magic-variables">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Magic Variables</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<p>
				Inside a pattern there are some variables that indicate how the pattern is called.
				These variables don't need to be defined explicitly but they can be used like any other variables. They are called <em>magic variables</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main purpose of magic variables is to make a pattern usable with chords consisting of different numbers of notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="reference">Magic Variables</span> table shows which variables exist and what they contain.
				The example column contains their value if the pattern is called with a chord containing 5 notes.

			<h3>$ALL</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Sometimes a pattern only contains a rhythm, and all notes of the chord are playing this rhythm simultaneously.
				But the very same rhythm can be played with different chords from different channels and a different number of notes or even drum instruments.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this case you can use <code>$ALL</code> instead of the note indices, like the following example demonstrates.
				It is taken from "Guillaume Tell", an opera from "Gioachino Rossini".
				Here we show a very minimal version with only 3 channels in measure 261:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-magic-all }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The pattern <code>8r8r</code> defines a combination that's used from several channels.
				In channel 5 it's called with a single note. In channel 4 the same pattern is played with 2-note chords.
				And the percussion channel plays it with a "chord" consisting of three percussion instruments.
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>$ALL</code> is also useful for nested patterns. Here's an example from the same composition:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-magic-all-nested }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The pattern <code>8ss8ss</code> uses the pattern <code>8ss</code> which uses the pattern <code>ss</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				All these patterns can be used with an arbitrary number of notes because they all use <code>$ALL</code>
				for playing the chord as well as for playing the nested pattern.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>$NC</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Let's rewrite our <code>upstroke</code> pattern so that it can be used with different guitar chords.
				A guitar has 6 strings, so a guitar chord can have up to 6 notes. But it can also have less.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first of the following examples is the re-written example for a variable number of notes. The second example
				is the one we already know, but now supporting exactly 6 notes, just for a better comparison.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.pattern-magic-upstroke }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				In both versions we keep the flexibility to specify note length and distance with parameters.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second version is shorter but it doesn't work with smaller chords.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first version uses the magic variable <code>$NC</code> for conditional blocks.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first note (index <code>0</code>) exist always. So we don't need a conditional block for this one.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second note (index <code>1</code>) exists only for chords with 2 or more notes. So we wrap it into a block with the condition <code>$NC > 1</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other notes (index <code>2</code> until <code>5</code>) work accordingly. So they are wrapped into blocks with the conditions
				<code>$NC > 2</code> until <code>$NC > 5</code>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">

				The following example uses our new <code>upstroke</code> pattern with different chords with a number of different notes:

				Now we also want to have a more flexible <code>downstroke</code> pattern. Let's rewrite it, using our new <code>upstroke</code>.
