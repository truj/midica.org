			<h2>Instrument Definition Block</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Before you can play any sounds, you must define the instruments to be used by each channel.
				Every channel that will be used later must be initialized inside of a block beginning with
				<code>INSTRUMENTS</code> and ending with <code>END</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The only exception is the percussion channel (channel <em>9</em>) which may (but does not need to) be defined explicitly.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.instruments }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				Each line inside of this block contains 3 columns, separated by one or more whitespaces.
				The last column may also contain more whitespaces. These are not interpreted as separator but as a part of the content.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{!-- ensure a line break --}}</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>1st column</h3>
			<p>
				The first column contains the chanel number. Valid values are the numbers <code>0</code> - <code>15</code> and the symbol <code>p</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>p</code> is just an alias for <code>9</code> which is the percussion channel number.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>2nd column</h3>
			<p>
				The second column describes the instrument. It may contain a valid <em>instrument ID</em> or <em>drumkit ID</em> or the accoring <em>MIDI program number</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Valid instrument or drumkit IDs can be found in the <em>info window</em> under <a href="/screenshots.html#info-config">Configuration</a>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>3rd column</h3>
			<p>
				The third column contains a description of the instrument. This will be displayed as a channel comment in the player.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				In the above example we use an <em>instrument ID</em> for the channels <em>0</em> and <em>1</em>, a <em>MIDI program number</em> for
				channel <em>2</em>, and a <em>drumkit ID</em> for channel <em>9</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The line defining the percussion channel (<em>p</em>) is optional. If it is omitted, the standard drumkit
				(MIDI program number <em>0</em>) is used.
			</p>
		</div>

	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="channel-commands">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Channel Commands (Compact)</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				After you have defined some channel instruments, you can use <em>(compact) channel commands</em> in order to play music.
				The most important things to do with channel commands is playing notes, chords or rests.
			</p>
			<p>
				A compact channel command is a line beginning with the channel, followed by a <code>:</code>.
				The rest of the line can consist of notes, chords, rest and so on, being played on the channel.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example plays a C Major Scale in Channel 0:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.cmaj }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Instead of the last note, we defined a rest using the symbol <code>-</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				As long as we don't define a note length, a quarter note is assumed. This applies for rests as well.
				But we can add a length definition to a note or rest, separated with a <code>:</code>.
				This will be the new default length for the channel.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example plays the beginning of "Happy Birthday" in channel 0:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.happy-birthday-compact }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				<code>c:8</code> plays a c with the length of an 8th note. At the same time it switches the default note length to an 8th note.
				So the next <code>c</code> (without note length) is still an 8th.
			</p>
			<p>
				This command can also be split into several lines. But in this case every line needs to be opened with the channel number and a colon.
				Here is the same example, split into three lines:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.happy-birthday-compact-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				In the first line we play only one note, and we switched the default note length to an 8th note.
				This new default is also valid for further lines of the same channel.
				So for the first note of the second line, we don't need a modifier to play another 8th.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				You can add a dot to the note length in order to get a dotted note.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows a more accurate version of "Happy Birthday":
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.happy-birthday-compact-3 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Note Names</h3>
			<p>
				Which note names are valid, depends on the configured <em>note system</em>, <em>half tone symbol</em> and <em>octave naming</em>.
				In the standard configuration, lower-cased international note names are used, and the half tone symbols are <code>#</code> for a
				sharp and <code>b</code> for a flat.
				Then follows an octave modifier.
			</p>
			<p>
				The octave beginning with the middle C is not modified.
			</p>
			<p>
				Higher octaves are modified with <code>+</code>, <code>+2</code>, <code>+3</code> and so on.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lower octaves are modified with <code>-</code>, <code>-2</code>, <code>-3</code> and so on.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows the first bar of "Through the Never" by "Metallica", played in channel 1.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.through-the-never }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Double sharps (<code>##</code>) or double flats (<code>bb</code>) are also possible, like these:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>f##</code> (same as <code>g</code>)</li>
				<li><code>f##+</code> (same as <code>g+</code>)</li>
				<li><code>f##+2</code> (same as <code>g+2</code>)</li>
				<li><code>dbb</code> (same as <code>c</code>)</li>
				<li><code>dbb+3</code> (same as <code>c+3</code>)</li>
				<li><code>cbb+3</code> (same as <code>bb+2</code> or <code>a#+2</code>)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Using multiple channels</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Different channels can play notes at the same time.
				Each channel command appends a note (or something else) to the end of a channel.
				So the order of channel commands for the same channel is important.
				But the order of commands for different channels does not matter.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following examples are equivalent. They play the first two bars of "Jingle Bells".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.jingle-bells }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The first example adds all notes to channel 0 before adding all notes to channel 1.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second example begins with channel 1 and then handles channel 0.
			</p>
			<p>
				The third example works more or less in the order of appearance of the notes in time.
				Of cause this is not always possible because some notes are played simultaniously but
				two channel commands cannot be written into the same line of source code.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the third example you can also see that a note length switch applies only to the channel where it occurs.
				The <code>e</code> In the second line is still a 4th because the note switch in the first line applies only for
				channel 1 but not for channel 0.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="chords">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Chords</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A chord in MidicaPL is an amount of notes to be played at the same time in the same channel, with the same length and velocity.
				There are 2 types of chords: <em>inline</em> chords and <em>predefined</em> chords.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Inline Chords</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				An inline chord is a number of notes, separated by a <code>,</code>. There are no whitespaces allowed between the notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows the beginning of Bob Marley's song "No Woman No Cry".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.chords }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The piano is played in channel 1 using inline chords.
				The singer's voice is played in Channel 0 without chords.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Predefined Chords</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				In order to use a predefined chord, the chord must be defined somewhere.
				Usually a chord definition consists of 3 or more columns, separated by whitespaces.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first column is the keyword <code>CHORD</code>.
				The second column is a self-given chord name.
				The other column(s) contain the notes belonging to that chord, one note by column.
				The notes can be separated either by <code>,</code> symbols or whitespaces or both.
			</p>
			<p>
				Between the chord name and the notes, you may optionally add a <code>=</code> instead of (or as well as) whitespaces.
				The following examples are all similar chord definitions:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>CHORD c-maj c e g</code></li>
				<li><code>CHORD c-maj c,e,g</code></li>
				<li><code>CHORD c-maj=c,e,g</code></li>
				<li><code>CHORD c-maj = c, e, g</code></li>
				<li><code>CHORD c-maj = c , e , g</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Predefined chords can be used like normal notes inside of a channel command. But instead of the note name, the self-given chord name is used.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows the same notes again but this time with predefined chords instead of inline chords.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.chords-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				As you can see in this example, the chord doesn't need to be defined <em>before</em> using it. It can also be defined <em>later</em>, like
				the <code>f-maj</code> chord here.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imagine you use the same chord (e.g. C-major) many times in a song. And then you want to modify the chord (e.g. transform it into C-maj-7).
				With predefined chords you only need to change the chord definition while with inline chords you need to change every appearance.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="global-commands">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Global Commands</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				While channel commands only affect one channel, there are also global commands that affect more than one channel.
				Most of them even affect all channels. A global command begins with the symbol <code>*</code> in it's first column.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Synchronize</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Every global command syncronizes all (or at least some) channels. That means the current channel lengths are made equal to
				the furthest channel's length.
				A global command adds an according amount of rests to all other channels.
				So many that all synchronized channels have the same length as the furthest channel.
			</p>
			<p>
				This behaviour can be very helpful. So even a global command without any further options can be useful.
				This empty form of a global command is called <em>synchronize</em> command because it's only purpose is to synchronize all channels.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows the first 2 measures of "The Black Perl" by "Klaus Badelt" from the film
				"Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Perl".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.the-black-perl }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Channel 1 contains a lot of rests but none of them is written with a channel command.
				The rests are added implicitely by adding a synchronize command at the end of each bar.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Partial Synchronize</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				If you want to synchronize only a part of the channels, you can use a partial synchronize command.
				In the second column of a partial synchronzie there is a description which channels should be synchronized.
			</p>
			<p>
				This description can be a comma-separated list of channel numbers (e.g. <code>1,2,3</code>) or a range
				like <code>1-3</code>) or a mix like <code>1-3,5,6-8,11</code>. Whitespaces are forbidden inside of the channel description.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use the symbol <code>p</code> for channel 9 here as well.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.partial-sync }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				This example synchronizes channels 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 13 and 14 with each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				The partial synchronize is the only global command that synchronizes only a part of the channels.
				All other types of global commands always synchronize all channels.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Set Tempo</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Another important global command is a tempo change. The tempo is defined in "beats per minute" (BPM).
				The second column of the global command contains the symbol <code>tempo</code> and the third column the desired value.
			</p>
			<p>
				The value is the number of quarter notes that is played in one minute.
				The default value is 120. It could be changed to 150 using the following command:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.set-tempo }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Like every other global command, a tempo change synchronizes all channels.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p class="hint">
				The following global commands ("time signature" and "key signature") are not audible. They only add meta information to the MIDI sequence.
				If you are only interested in hearable commands, you can continue directly with <a href="tutorial-2.html">chapter 2</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Set Time Signature</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The time signature can be set with the <code>time</code> command in the second column. The third column contains
				the desired time definition.
			</p>
			<p>
				The time definition contains a <i>nominator</i> (number) and a <i>denominator</i>, separated by a <code>/</code>.
				<br />
				The MIDI default is a <em>4/4</em> beat.
				<br />
				A <em>3/4</em> beat would be defined like this:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.set-time }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The denominator must be a number that can be described as 2<sup>n</sup>. That means valid denominators are <em>1</em>, <em>2</em>,
				<em>4</em>, <em>8</em>, <em>16</em>, <em>32</em>, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				The time signature does not change the sound of the MIDI sequence at all. However it can make sence to define it anyway.
				It can be a useful hint for third-party software processing the MIDI file exported by Midica.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Set Key Signature</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The key signature can be set with the <code>key</code> command in the second column. The third column contains the desired key definition.
			</p>
			<p>
				The key definition contains a valid note name and a tonality, separated by a <code>/</code>.
				<br />
				The tonality can be <code>maj</code> for <em>major</em> or <code>min</code> for <em>minor</em>.
				<br />
				The MIDI default is <em>C major</em>, which could also be defined explicitely by the following command:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.set-key }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				What a <i>valid note name</i> is, depends on the configured Note System, Half Tone Symbol and Octave Naming.
				In the standard configuration a <em>C# minor</em> could be set with one of the following commands.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.set-key-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Of cause these commands are equal because the octave is irrelevant for the key signature.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like the time signature, the key signature does not change the sound at all. But it can also be useful for
				another software processing the produced MIDI sequence.
			</p>
			<p>
				Internally the key signature is translated into a number of <i>sharps</i> or <i>flats</i> and a flag for major or minor.
				Midica tries to be as close as possible to the intended key signature. But MIDI has a limitation that allows a
				maximum of 7 sharps or flats. So in some cases the key signature is converted automatically to something corresponding.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example a <em>D# major</em> would have 9 sharps which is more than the allowed 7. So it's converted to the corresponding
				<em>Eb major</em> with 3 flats instead.
